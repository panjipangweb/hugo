I once believed your love was mine,
A fleeting star, a flame divine.
Yet Epictetus taught me clear,
What is not mine, I must not fear.

The heart, like all, belongs to fate,
Not yours to give, not mine to take.
And though you’ve left, and silence reigns,
It’s not in loss that strength remains.

Marcus spoke of nature’s flow,
To let things come, and let things go.
And in your absence, I find peace—
What withers now was meant to cease.

Seneca, too, in letters wise,
Whispered truths beneath the skies:
That grief’s a wave, but it must pass,
For what we lose was never ours to grasp.

I stand, unmoved, as fate unwinds,
In loss, I find the ties unbind.
For in this pain, I understand—
Love's not a chain, but open hand.

You were a thought, a fleeting dream,
But they know, all things redeem.
The heart must break, but not for woe,
For through its cracks, the light will flow.
