You left me here, a withered tree,
Barren limbs that used to be.
Once, you were my roots, my rain,
Now only drought, only pain.

In twilight's grasp, I stand alone,
A kingdom lost, a shattered throne.
Your promises, like brittle glass,
Shattered echoes from the past.

I built my walls, you wore them thin,
Tore them down, let darkness in.
Tortured whispers fill the air,
My heart's a grave, you buried there.

A mariner adrift in your sea,
No stars, no winds to carry me.
I gave you all, each breath, each part,
Now drown in the depths of a broken heart.

Like distant bells, your silence rings,
The hollow sound of forgotten things.
You forged my chains, left me bound,
In love's dark dungeon, I am crowned.

Yet even now, in shattered state,
I dance with sorrow, shoulder fate.
For in this ruin, I find my flame,
Though broken, I shall rise again.
